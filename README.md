# Project1 - Zurich:50   
  This repository is created for the first project in "Tools in Data Science" from IIT Madras BS Degree in Data Science. 

### Scraping the Data
  * Data scraped using the GitHub API through Google Colab. Data is filtered based on given criteria. Couple of issues faced and solved them using Co-Pilot. Data Frames of Pandas came handy in scraping the raw data into required format
    
### Surprising fact
  * Copilot came handy to help with the syntax and solution for the queries, it was providing multiple solutions based on the ask. This tool is able to pick the content from the search, user is doing and customize to the needs even when the input provided is less. Hard refresh of the browser !!! Not always Pandas, excel provides quick and easy solution ðŸ˜‰

### Recommendation for developers
  *  Unwind the old school of development, explore more the readily available tools and reduce manual effort to larger extent.
